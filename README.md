# Machine Learning Capstone â€“ Boosting Score Predictor

This capstone project uses Python and ensemble learning methods (Boosting) to predict exam scores based on student features.

## Features:
- Trained multiple boosting models: XGBoost, LightGBM, AdaBoost
- Compared accuracy, precision, recall on test data
- Visualized feature importance and performance metrics

## Tools:
- Python, scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
- Jupyter Notebooks

## Repo structure:
- `notebooks/`: All experiments
- `models/`: Saved models
- `data/`: Preprocessed datasets

## Outcome:
- Best model achieved 89% test accuracy
- Clear visualization of which student behaviors drive score outcomes
