# Machine Learning Capstone: 4-Week Project

## Overview
This capstone project represents the culmination of a 4-week intensive machine learning course focused on practical, portfolio-ready skills using Python, scikit-learn, and Git. Each week built a standalone project, with Week 4 featuring a Gradient Boosting model to predict final student scores.

## Weekly Breakdown

**Week 1:**  
- Project: Simple Linear Regression  
- Skills: Data preprocessing, model fitting, RMSE evaluation  

**Week 2:**  
- Project: Classification (Spam Detection or similar)  
- Skills: NLP, TF-IDF vectorization, train/test split  

**Week 3:**  
- Project: Hyperparameter Tuning  
- Skills: GridSearchCV, Boosting overview, model comparison  

**Week 4 (Capstone):**  
- Project: Final Score Prediction  
- Model: GradientBoostingRegressor  
- Features: Clean CSV input, RMSE output, Git version control  
- Files: `boost_model.py`, `boosting_scores.csv`, `README.md`

## Tools & Libraries
